Professional Learning Seminar (PLS) II, which occurs in Year Two of the BEd program, places a greater focus on \\\"transition to practice\\\" (e.g., resume-writing, interview skills, supply teaching, etc.)."

The key objective of this course is to familiarize the students with key information technologies used in manipulating, storing, and analyzing big data. We look at the basic tools for statistical analysis, R and Python, and some key methods of machine learning. We review MapReduce techniques for parallel processing, Hadoop, an open source framework for running MapReduce on Internet scale problems and HDFS, Hadoop's Distributed File System. We teach Spark which emerged as the most important big data processing framework. We touch on tools that provide SQL-like access to unstructured data like Hive. We analyze so-called NoSQL storage solutions exemplified by Cassandra for their critical features: speed of reads and writes, and ability to scale to extreme volumes. We examine memory resident databases (VoltDB, SciDB) and graph databases (Ne4J). Students gain the ability to initiate and design highly scalable systems that can accept, store, and analyze large volumes of unstructureddata in batch mode and/or real time. Most lectures are presented using Java examples. Some lectures use Python and R."

      "description": "Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets. Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about people's opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. This course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines."

This course moves beyond traditional lifestyle' explanations of health and wellness and provides students with a solid understanding of how social factors contribute to inequities in health care access and population health outcomes. We will examine how social exclusion, income, early life experiences, employment and working conditions, unemployment and employment insecurity, housing, food security, Aboriginal status, and social policy determine health. We also explore why the biomedical and lifestyle models of health are the primary ways that Canadians think about health, the policy implications of the current state of knowledge, and what can be done to inform change."

Yet almost daily world attention is focused on now volatile areas once under Ottoman hegemony: parts of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, Israel and Arab countries, North African states such as Egypt and Algeria. At the same time the Ottoman Impact on European history over the centuries is largely obscured by observations of European decline at the hands of 19-century European powers. This course introduces students to the history of the Ottoman Empire between 1299-1920. It will examine both chronological developments as well as diverse themes that point to the richness of Ottoman history."

These developments resulted in the emergence of fields called quantum computers and quantum communication. In order to make the theoretically predicted breakthrough a reality, one needs to design a new class of devices based on optical and/or solid state fundamentals where quantum effects play the dominant role. One possible way to achieve this goal is by shrinking the dimensions of physical devices but this is not always the case, as it is known that quantum effects are important and even directly observed in macroscopic systems. However, as the physical dimensions get smaller, e.g. as is the case of semiconductor integrated circuits, one enters the quantum nano-world."

A central premise of the course is that reconciliation requires an active awareness of this history as part of the process towards decolonizing Canadian institutions, including the profession of social work that is our focus. As such, students will critically look into the past, present,and future of missions (e.g., Christian, Residential Schools, Social Work 60s Scoop) that had the goal of helping Indigenous communities, but more often were central to their disempowerment and resulting social impacts. We are concerned with the problematic relations between Indigenous communities and social work as a means for beginning to consider what healing entails for both the Indigenous survivors of intergenerational trauma and a profession that is implicated in this social violence. To learn about the potential future of our healing profession, we will follow the lead of Indigenous worldviews and experiences as it pertains to understanding this colonizing history and what healing entails. These views will be brought into a dialogue with social work research that has the potential for fostering more respectful relations. Those learners who see themselves working with First Nations, Inuit, and/or Metis communities as a social worker will benefit from the specific decolonizing knowledge and perspectives on healing that this course offers, though a more comprehensive engagement of holistic healing practices will be covered in SK422."
